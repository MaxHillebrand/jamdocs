## Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ compiles questions that relate to Jam in particular. For things related
to JoinMarket in general, please refer to the [JoinMarket documentation][jm-docs].

### How much can I earn?

Earning sats entails providing liquidity to other market participants.
Consequently, how much you can earn depends on multiple factors, market
conditions and liquidity size being two of them. In general, the more liquidity
you provide, the more you can earn. That being said, you are competing in an
open market, and because competition is global and only constraint by market
forces, the margin is usually thin.

If your offers are not taken by market participants, your offer might be too
expensive. Check the [order book][orderbook] and compare your offer to the
market price. If your offer is competitive and is still ignored, make sure to
create a [Fidelity Bond][glossary], which signals that you are a serious market
participant and not a malicious entity.

documentation.

### How high are the fees that I do have to pay?

The amount of [fees][fees] you have to pay depends on market and blockspace
conditions. They are dictated by supply and demand, both for collaborative
transactions and single user transactions.

Market [makers][glossary] provide liquidity and set the fee they want to earn,
either in absolute or percentage terms. Market [takers][glossary] have to agree
to take these offers voluntarily. Check the [orderbook][orderbook] to get an
up-to-date overview of the current fee market.

In addition to these fees, you will have to pay mining fees for you and the makers. Mining fees depend
on how many transactions are currently in the [mempool][glossary]. Inspect your
mempool or use a public site like [mempool.space][ms] to do a fee estimation.

!!! hint

    We recommended that you [run your own mempool.space
    instance][ms-install] on your full node.

### I'm getting an error when trying to open the wallet

The following error can pop up in case JoinMarket didnt't shut down cleanly:

```
wallet.jmdat cannot be created/opened, it is locked.
```

!!! warning
    Make sure that you have **written down your wallet seed** before executing
    *any* command

You can resolve this by manually deleting the wallet `.lock` file as explained
in [issue #173][lockfile-issue].

### Something is/seems stuck; what can I do?

TODO

(hint: service feedback not yet provided; it's always safe to cancel operations;
no loss of funds)

### No connection to gateway

TODO

(hint: check service is running; check ports are open) can also be reverse proxy
issues; reverse proxy is still mandatory (this is a pain point for me.. we need
to get rid of it) don't know if we should go into details why it is needed or
what the differences are
