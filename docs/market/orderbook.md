# Orderbook

The order book (or orderbook) shows what kind of offers are currently on the
market. It gives insights in regards to offer types, [fees][fees], offer sizes, and
[fidelity bonds][fb] put up by [market makers][makers].

[fees]: fees.md
[fb]: ../glossary.md#fidelity-bond
[makers]: ../glossary.md#maker

Jam will set up a service that allows you to watch the order book on your node.
This removes the trust in a third party. You can view the order book directly in
Jam via the "Show orderbook" button on the [Earn][earn] screen.

There are also public order books that you can inspect, in case you do not have
access to your own node:
