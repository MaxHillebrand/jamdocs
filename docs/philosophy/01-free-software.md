# Free Software

Jam is free as in *freedom*. We believe that free software is an imperative for
a free society, which is why Jam is released under a free software [license].

Bitcoin is financial software. Consequently, any financial liberation that is
enabled by Bitcoin rests on the four essential freedoms granted by free
software.

Free software puts the users in control, both collectively and individually.
Free software is not only about being "open" and "more secure." While these are
nice side-effects, the main issue is about control and respecting user's
freedoms.

Most software and software products force the user into a master-slave
relationship, as do most monetary systems and financial products. Bitcoin is
freedom money because the software that makes Bitcoin possible is free
software—free as in freedom. There are no masters, only peers.
