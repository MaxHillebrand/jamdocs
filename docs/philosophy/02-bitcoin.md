# Bitcoin

There is much to be said about Bitcoin and why it was created. Many books have
been written, much speculation was and is still being had in terms of Satoshi's
"true" vision and motivation.[^brc]

Undoubtedly, there are certain values embodied in the Bitcoin system—certain
opinions that are embedded in the code, expressing how things should be done and
what should be avoided. Nothing makes this more clear than [the
announcement post][announcement] of Bitcoin, written by Satoshi himself.

Below are some highlights that are particularly relevant:

No central server. No trusted third party. Peer-to-peer (P2P), instead of
client-server or master-slave.

Thanks to strong cryptography, trust in third parties can be eliminated. When
possible, rely on cryptographic proof instead of trust. Trusted third parties
should be eliminated because (a) they introduce friction and (b) they are
security holes.[^szabo]

Privacy. Admins that spy on you. Systems that are designed to spy on you.
Unfortunately, it's almost non-existent in today's world of surveillance
capitalism and dragnet surveillance.

While credit requires identity, money does not. When you can trust the money you
don't have to trust the person. In Bitcoin, there are no persons; only
pseudonymous identities. Identities that are generated cryptographically at
virtually no cost.

No middlemen. Secure and effortless. The reason why your browser will show you a
green lock or a shield when a connection is encrypted is that privacy and
security are two sides of the same coin. Without privacy, your physical security
might be at risk.[^lopp] Without privacy, free thought and free speech are
impeded.

> The result is a distributed system with **no single point of failure.**

No single point of failure. No admins.That is one of the main value propositions
of Bitcoin, and what makes it so resilient. This resiliency, and the fact that
the users are in charge—and nobody else—is what sets Bitcoin apart. JoinMarket
continues this philosophical approach: economic actors in a peer-to-peer system,
no single point of failure.
