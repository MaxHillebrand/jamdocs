# Installation

Jam comes packaged with the following full-node solutions:

- [Umbrel](#with-umbrel)
- [Citadel](#with-citadel)
- [Raspiblitz](#with-raspiblitz)

You should be able to install Jam with one click if you are running any of the
above. You can also do a [manual installation](#manual-installation).

## Install as a Package

The easiest way to install Jam is to install it as a package.

    package. Make sure to verify the integrity and authenticity of the node
    software you are running. And, if possible, [verify the Jam
